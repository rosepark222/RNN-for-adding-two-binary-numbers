adding two 8 bit binary numbers using RNN.

TF_binary_add.py  
	tensorflow implementation, stochastic gradient descent
siraj_rnn_binary_add.py 
	numpy implementation (no extra library)
siraj_rnn_tensorflow_echo_gen.py 
	I learned to use specific training method in this example. 
	It is based on minibatch gradient descent.
